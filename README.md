# SmartRaycast
_This resource was created for me familiarize myself with creating open source resources and because it is a dependency of another resource I'm making_ 

## What does this do?
* Centralizes Raycast Parameters. All Parameters are derived from the same module.
- Avoid useless boilerplate/duplicate code 
* Limits overhead caused by maintaining FilterDescendantsInstances
